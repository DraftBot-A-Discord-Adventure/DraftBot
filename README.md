DraftBot is a bot developed in Node.js by [@BastLast](https://github.com/BastLast) based on a text adventure game. The
story takes place in a medieval world, and the player embodies an adventurer who wants to win a competition held by
the king, to win the princess' hand. To achieve this, he must travel and earn points by going through a lot of danger,
thieves, wilderness, and scary children. Every few hours, the player can get a random event by using the "report"
command which allows the user to interact with a multiple choice system using reactions below the report. Each choice has multiple
issues, which could hurt the character, heal them, or give them useful items. During the journey, they earn money,
items, and points. These can use them to buy potions, items or effects in the shop, fight other players, and ascend the
leaderboard.
